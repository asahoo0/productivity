## Project Proposal:Productivity App

### Questions:
#### What project you want to do?
I want to make a productivity app.
#### What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? (Put another way, in what way will you be motivated to see this project to completion?)

I want to create a productivity app with user customization. For background knowledge, I use a lot of productivity apps and I've tried many different ones out. I want to do this project to create a personalized productivity app for myself because I haven't found a app that helped for me longterm. So in short, I want to make a productivity app because I haven't found one that works for me but in the process of trying out many productivity apps I have a general sense of their components. Another reason I want to do a productivity app is because they have many small parts so it'll be easier to have something presentable than in other projects in which the parts rely on each other.

#### A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")

By week 1, I want to have all my app pages defined and be able to switch between pages. I also want the user to be able to set a timer and keep a record of the time spent. Lastly, for week one I want the user to be able to create a basic counter to keep track of multiple habits and how many times they accomplished them. For week 2, I'd like to make the app customizable so the user can edit elements of the layout like font and background color. I'd also like the user to be able to save personal notes. With this I'd also like to add a search feature so the user can easily find a note. For week 3, I'd like to create a to-do list. I'd also like to extend the search feature into week 3 onto the to-do list. I also want to add a reminder that reminds the user in x number of minutes. Finally, during week 3, I'd like to add sound effects to the app. For example, when the timer rings there should be a sound.

#### If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
Some stretch goals I thought about were allowing the user to handwrite and draw in the note portion of the app, allowing the user to add images to their notes, and having a username password system for the app. For importing images the user could use custom images as backgrounds and also put images in their texr. For the username password system, the way it'd work is that it'd show different data based on the username and password and also no data if the username and password are invalid.

###### Week 1

* app pages defined and you can switch between pages
* user can set timer
* time spent tracker
* habit tracker

###### Week 2

* allow user to edit layout like font color and background color
* add notes feature
* add find/search feature in notes

###### Week 3

* add a to do list
* add a reminder page
* add search feature to to-do list
* add beep sound effects to the app

###### Stretch

* calendar for to-do list items
* allow user to write/draw
* allow user to add images
* custom background images
* username password system
